## Julian Ng
### Consultant Converted Coder

Prior to joining Makers Academy, I was a management consultant specialising in innovation, business change and data analytics. During my 8 years in this role, I provided advice and support to internal and external clients in the defence, government, transport, engineering and aerospace industries. My final project was desgining, developing and delivering an Intelligence as a Service offering for the business from the ground up.

In 2017, I decided that I needed a change in my career, and so I (finally!) made the jump into the weird and wonderful world of programming. I made this decision based on two main factors.
1) This has long been an interest of mine - my favourite past projects as a management consultant were those that involved designing and building bespoke tools and models, typically to churn through masses of data to derive meaningful insights and generate visualisations. Developing a tangible output which would improve the customer's operations, and the journey of getting there - overcoming many obstacles and learning new things each day - has always been extremely satisfying for me. 

2) My partner and I recently lost our home and all our possessions in a fire. This might seem like an odd reason to make me want to become a programmer but it was a major catalyst to getting me where I am now. After this traumatic event we went travelling to take time to contemplate our life choices and happiness. From this, I committed myself to being less risk-averse and truer to my heart, and to start doing what's better for me in the long term - professionally and personally. 

So, I left my job to have a fresh start in 2018, and I have the honour of doing that with Makers Academy. At the end of this journey, I hope to join a Small-Medium Enterprise as all my professional experience to date has been with large multinational corporations and I am looking for the close-knit family feel of an SME. The combination of skills and experience as a management consultant with my newly acquired programming capapbilities means I am well-rounded, commercially astute and highly motivated.
