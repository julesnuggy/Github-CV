# Julian Ng

Junior full-stack developer with a passion for developing beautiful apps using simple code. I have experience across client-side, server-side and database technologies using object oriented design. I have a partial bias towards front-end development for its visual creativity but I am also strong at applying back-end logic. My ultimate goal is to become a game developer but I appreciate that there is a lot I can learn along the way from other industries.

I spent the first 8 years of my professional career as a business change & analytics consultant until I finally decided to re-train to become a software developer, which has been a long-held and much-delayed ambition of mine. I have a passion for problem solving and a keen eye for detail which, when combined with my previous professional experience, provides me with a strong foundation for programming.

# Skills
## Analysis and Reporting
I am highly experienced in analysing vast amounts of complex data to generate meaningful insights and inform critical business decisions. I regularly reported these findings and recommendations to stakeholders via written reports and delivering presentations.
* I was the **Lead Analyst** for an organisation-wide cultural assessment for Dstl, who sought to implement new knowledge sharing practices to strengthen their innovative capabilities.
* I analysed 500+ responses to a structured questionnaire I developed in accordance with an established assessment tool, and generated the subsequent findings report.
* The report identified current and desired organisational cultures; recommended steps to move towards the desired culture; and outlined how this would impact the customer going forward.
* My work provided the customer with a quantitative view of which initiatives and methods to employ, ensuring effective and efficient allocation of resources.

## Leadership
As a leader, I take an approach which combines emotional intelligence, open communication, trust, and personal development.
* In the role of **UK Solution Lead for Thales Intelligence Services**, I was responsible for developing and delivering a new UK-wide service from the ground up.
* I led a team comprising of analysts and managers to develop the business case (market demand, competition, partnerships, financial model, business model, etc.); deliver the marketing campaign; and manage the opportunity pipeline.
* I led a team of junior and experienced analysts to deliver the launched service, appropriately delegating tasks and coordinating with international partners.
* My role resulted in delivery of intelligence reporting to government, police, defence and transport clients across the UK.

## Stakeholder Management
I am able to confidently engage with and manage internal and external stakeholders across all levels, from junior team members to senior customer executives.
* In the role of **Thales Frameworks Manager**, I was responsible for managing all aspects of the company’s most critical frameworks, which were pipelines for potential work valued up to £2M each.
* I presented proposal cases to company stakeholders, coordinated inter-business unit bid teams, engaged with external partners, worked alongside commercial teams, and negotiated with framework and customer contacts.
* My role resulted in consistently high-quality bids, adherence to company policies and processes, and continued participation on the frameworks.

## Project Management
I am able to manage projects to deliver high quality outcomes to time and budget. This includes management of time, resources, work packages and documentation.
* For the **Acebook project**, I managed the project and team to ensure delivery of a product we would be proud to present.
* Responsibilities included facilitating decisions (team objective, MVP specification, feature prioritisation), team co-ordination (stand-ups, retros, task assignation, ad hoc workshops), and managing documentation (Trello card wall, Wiki, README).
* This resulted in effective teamwork, working around illnesses / absences, to deliver a quality product in just 2 weeks.

# Hobbies
I go to the gym 3-4 times a week as it is important for me to stay physically fit. I train my brain all the time so my body needs to keep up.

Travelling is a passion for me - seeing, learning and experiencing other countries, cultures and (importantly) food!

I'm also an avid gamer - a PlayStation loyalist with a love for the Final Fantasy series. My desire to work in the gaming industry stems from this passion.

As a linguist, I love to learn other languages - I can speak Cantonese, Mandarin, and Spanish.
