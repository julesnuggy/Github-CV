# Julian Ng
## Consultant Converted Coder

After 8 years of working as a business change & analytics consultant, I have re-trained to become a software developer, which has been a long-held and much-delayed ambition of mine. I have a passion for problem solving and a keen eye for detail which, when combined with my previous professional experience, provides me with a strong foundation for programming.

As a junior full-stack developer, I have experience across client-side, server-side and database technologies. That said, I have a partial bias towards front-end development for its visual creativity. My ultimate goal is to become a game developer but I appreciate that there is a lot I can learn along the way from other industries.

## Programming Skills

_Ruby_

Skill currently under development at Makers Academy. Currently able to create simple interactive programs involving fundamental objects, methods, classes, standard inputs/outputs, working computer files, and version control on Github.

_JavaScript_

Skill initially self-taught via https://www.freecodecamp.org and now under development at Makers Academy. Currently able to create simple programs using fundamental methods and objects.

_HTML & CSS_

- https://julesnuggy.github.io -- My personal webpage developed as part of my application for the Founders & Coders bootcamp. I rapidly learnt HTML, CSS and JavaScript in just 1 month to develop this page.
- Four Seasons Take Away -- Set up a simple website for my mother's take away business, including a landing page, text-based menu with icons, and contact details. The business has since been sold as my mother retired.

_VBA for Excel_

Over the years, I have designed, developed and delivered numerous bespoke tools and spreadsheet models for clients of varying complexity. A selection of these tools includes:
- Thales Sales Operations Support -- Converted existing manual processes and documents into a suite of interactive and automated tools to streamline and improve the accuracy and reliability of monthly sales order intake and opportunity pipeline assessment & monitoring.
- Thales Transport Management System Performance Analysis -- Developed a tool with industry-expert input to assess the Performance Metrics and Measures of the company's rail TMS solution to provide quantified and qualified evidence of performance improvement achieved against existing systems installed by Network Rail
- Royal Navy "Ice Pick" -- Journey planning calculation and optimisation toolset to support RN ice patrol and survey operations.
- Royal Navy MHPC Future Capability Study -- A complex suite of tools to analyse over 150 RN mission packages to identify optimal options to meet the client’s financial and operational needs over 10, 20 and 50 years. 

## Consultancy SKills
_Business Analysis & Organisational Studies_

Produced and presented use cases for Information, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) CONOPS through desktop research, stakeholder interviews and innovation.
- Dstl Organisational Culture for Improving Knowledge Management -- An organisation-wide cultural assessment for Dstl who sought to implement new knowledge sharing practices to strengthen their innovative capabilities. The assessment was conducted to: identify current and desired organisational cultures using the Organisational Cultural Assessment Instrument (OCAI); recommend steps to move towards the desired culture (implementation options, risks analysis and expected benefits); and understand how this would impact their current and future knowledge management initiatives.
- Enhanced Multi-Sensor Information Presentation -- A Dstl study into the effectiveness of on-screen information in Head-Up Displays when used in infantry synthetic training (VBS2) as part of research into innovative Situational Awareness technologies/methods. 

_Change Management & Organisational Studies_

Performed Gap Analysis and presented reccomendations to improve operational effectiveness through organisational change without impacting headcount.
- Thales Facility Capability Assessment -- A study into Thales UK’s RF/microwave capabilities (facilities, products and resources) to align supply and demand. Inspected internal and external supply chains, interviewed senior stakeholders, and facilitated workshops to derive the ‘As Is’ and ‘To Be’ states, and propose options and recommendations with associated risk analysis.
- Thales Corporate Benefits Realisation Management (BRM) Strategy Development -- Develolped the BRM strategy and capability for Thales UK’s corporate portfolio of internal change initiatives. Developed a bespoke tool and process, and implemented these to enable the client to capture, measure, monitor, optimise and report on the benefits and risks of change initiatives at project, programme and portfolio levels.
